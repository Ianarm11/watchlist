# Watchlist Test

## Comments
* I found this test difficult to do without a database or something similar. I could not find a good solution to keep track of the stocks in the table and their data. Their data gets re-generated every API call, which should not be happening. I thought about reading and writing to a JSON file to solve my issues, but that is not a great solution.

* I also do not have strong javascript skills. I built the client so that it would make an API call every 5 seconds to get new data for the table. I don't think I have the best method for putting that data into the table.

* A user can add to the table as many times as they like, but the newly added rows do not have random changing data.

* This took me about 4 hours of work, so I thought I would stop there because I was struggling.
